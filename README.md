### 4. Using Shortcodes

You can display QR codes on the front end of your site using the following shortcodes:

**Generic QR Code**
Displays a QR code for any data you provide.

`[qr_code data="https://your-website.com" size="200"]`

-   `data`: (Required) The URL or text to encode.
-   `size`: The size of the QR code in pixels (e.g., 150).
-   `color_dark`: Hex code for the dark modules (e.g., `#000000`).
-   `color_light`: Hex code for the light modules (e.g., `#ffffff`).
-   `error_level`: Error correction level (`L`, `M`, `Q`, `H`). `H` is the highest.

**Product QR Code**
Displays a QR code for a specific WooCommerce product.

`[qr_product id="123" show_product_info="true"]`

-   `id`: The WooCommerce product ID.
-   `size`: The size of the QR code in pixels.
-   `show_product_info`: Set to `true` to display the product name and price above the QR code.

**Analytics Shortcode**
Displays analytics data. This shortcode is only visible to users with `manage_options` capability (i.e., administrators).

`[qr_analytics show="summary" days="30"]`

-   `show`: The type of report to display. Options: `summary`, `chart`, `table`.
-   `days`: The number of past days to include in the report (e.g., 7, 30, 90).

## Database

The plugin creates three custom tables in the WordPress database to store its data:

-   `wp_qr_codes`: Stores information about each generated QR code, including the associated product ID, file path, and status.
-   `wp_qr_scans`: Records every scan, capturing the QR code ID, timestamp, IP address, and user agent.
-   `wp_qr_conversions`: Logs successful conversions attributed to a QR scan, including the order ID and revenue.

## Dependencies

-   **WooCommerce**: Required for all product-related functionality.
-   **chillerlan/php-qrcode**: A robust PHP library for generating QR codes.
-   **tecnickcom/tcpdf**: Used for generating high-quality PDF documents.

These PHP dependencies are managed via Composer and included with the plugin.
